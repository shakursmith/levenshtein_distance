# Assessment: Levenshtein Distance [Click here for Demo](https://levenshtein-distance-git-main-shakursmith.vercel.app)

> The goal is to build a web page with *React* that makes an *HTTP request* to a backend server that computes the "distance" between two strings.

> The web page is a simple form with two input fields and a "compute" action button to initiate the request to the backend server. The result, a number is displayed in another text field.

> For the HTTP backend, the goal is to accept a POST request from the form, extract the two strings and compute their distance, then return that distance to the web page.
